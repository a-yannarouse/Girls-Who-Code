Many autistic people, mostly adults, are seen as childish and underdeveloped who can’t function in the outside world. I feel like autistic people have disadvantages pertaining to society with school and work. People need to learn more about autism and learn that it is not a bad thing. Autistic people are very smart and developed but because of lack of communication, they are deemed as having a mental illness and anti-social.

        Autistic people are very smart people because their brains are wired to have obsessive traits and able to memorize many things. They also when they have natural talents can really flourish and make their talent stand out. Also, since they are smart by seeing things differently that are not seen by non-autistic people. There are many stereotypes that affect the community because they are not accepted for jobs and seem as anti - social because people think differently of their skills and communication. The unemployment rate is high for them because employers need someone who is able to communicate in most fields and they believe autistic people don’t have various interests in different fields including communicating with others.

People see autistic people as children with an illness unable to communicate properly and deem to be weird and an outcast. The major obstacles to finding positive, lasting change is changing people’s ideas and perspective as people can be stubborn due to limited knowledge. It is important to reach out and make people more aware about how autistic people really are and not what they are showing on the outside and what other people say.
