        <h2>Action Item List</h2>
        <p>
          Autistic people are different but the same as us. They didn't ask to
          have autism and it is not a bad thing but the world thinks
          differently. They deserve their natural rights just like any other
          human. I encourage you to be more involved and aware of the autism
          community because of misconceptions, the autism community is
          mistreated. This is important because the more the people understand
          and accept autistic people, they can live life without any
          discrimination regarding applying to jobs, homes, and social life.
          With your help, we can make for the autism community and make sure
          they have the same equal rights as everyone else. Autism is not a
          mental illness and it never will be.
